== Notes

{o-author} categorizes dumbing down arguements into 3 categories:

* I can’t find it
* I’m not used to it
* I’m terribly clever (and so are all my friends)

Points to counteract the dumbing down arguement:

* makes it easy to read (good structure, short sentences, plain language)
* opens up the information
* trys not to exclude people based on their education, cognitive function or reading ability
* makes it accessible

UK stats:

* 1.5 million people who have a learning disability
* 7 million (conservative estimation) people have dyslexia 
* 2 million people with a visual impairment

// Is there a source for these stats?

Other usability considerations:

* poor internet connection
* don’t want to read and re-read something just to understand it

== Quotes

What’s more important to your users: learning how to read your information or understanding it?
